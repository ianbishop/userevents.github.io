A *template* is used for creating messages that will be used in notification.
These templates allow you to insert variables from the event, responses from
other notifications or augmented values to create a personalized notification
for your customers.

For instance, if you wanted to send an email to someone who called your call
center but dropped from the queue, you could create a template with the email
body and insert their name into the email before it's sent.
