*Tenants* represent a partitioning of data within the CxEngage Platform. Using tenants allows
collections of key attribute, patterns, templates, listeners, and custom endpoint settings to be isolated to
a certain group of users. Tenant ids are defined by the CxEngage admin when creating the tenant and
must be universally unique.

A tenant must be assigned to a instance before its patterns become active in CxEngage. Once a user has
been assigned to a tenant, management of the tenant data can be performed through the CxEngage API.

Tenants are lightweight and can be created arbitrarily without having to create additional instances or installs.
