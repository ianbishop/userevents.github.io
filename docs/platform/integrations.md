*Integrations* are the mechanism through which endpoints and listeners are dynamically
defined and added to CxEngage. The integration defines the UI for setting the tenant specific
settings; the commands the endpoint exposes within the Notification DSL; and the UI/settings required
for defining a listener.

To enable an integration for use within a tenant, the integration must first be added to the tenant.
If the integration requires additional settings for the tenant, these settings can be added from
the CxEngage API after adding the integration to the tenant.
