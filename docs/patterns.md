A *pattern* describes a series of events that make up a customer's journey as
they interact with your company across channels. As a user of CxEngage, you
write patterns that match journeys which are important to your organization.

A pattern is comprised of two parts: *when* and *then*.

## When

Whens describe the series of events that make up the customer's journey.

If you wanted to be notified when a customer with a certain Klout score has tweeted
your company and has called in to your call centre queue, you would describe
this in the *when*.

## Then

Thens describe what action to take once a *when* has been matched.

If you wanted to trigger a phone call using Twilio, open an opportunity in
Salesforce or send a test notification using the test endpoint, you would
describe this in the *then*.
