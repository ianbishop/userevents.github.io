**Endpoints** allow you to send notifications through using the CxEngage DSL. Each
endpoint support different verbs, such as Twilio which supports `call` and
`sms`. For each verb, there are different parameters necessary to send that
notification.

Currently, the following **endpoints** are available:

* Twilio
* Salesforce
* Sendgrid
* Echo
* Pusher
* Urban Airship
* Generic
* Timer

If you need help using an endpoint, please visit the [Knowledge
Base](https://cxengage.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/sections/200181297-Endpoints) for in-depth guides for each endpoint.
