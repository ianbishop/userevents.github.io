An *endpoint* is a CxEngage service that allows you to reach out to third-party
services through notifications.

When creating a pattern, you define the `then` portion which is comprised of one
or more of these notifications, along with extra logic to get it just right.

You can use these endpoints to send notifications like:

* Calling a customer with Twilio
* Creating an opportunity in Salesforce
* Sending an email with SendGrid
* Simply testing with the Echo endpoint
