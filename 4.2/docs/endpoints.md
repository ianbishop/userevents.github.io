*Endpoints* are CxEngage services that help you reach out to third-party
services.

When you write a pattern, you can create notifications with endpoints such as
Twilio, Sendgrid, Pusher, Salesforce. There is also a generic endpoint that lets
you integrate with CxEngage directly.

Here are just a few samples of what you can do with CxEngage endpoints:

* Call a customer with Twilio
* Create opportunities with Salesforce
* Send email with SendGrid
* Test with the Echo endpoint
* Trigger notifications with Pusher
* Integrate your own app with the generic endpoint
