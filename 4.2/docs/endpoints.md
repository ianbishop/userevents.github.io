*Endpoints* are CxEngage services that help you reach out to third-party
services.

When you write a pattern, you can create notifications with endpoints such as
Twilio, Sendgrid, Pusher, and Salesforce. There is also a generic endpoint that lets
you send events to systems we don't have existing integrations with.

Here are just a few samples of what you can do with CxEngage endpoints:

* Call a customer with Twilio
* Create opportunities within Salesforce
* Send email with SendGrid
* Test with the Echo endpoint
* Trigger notifications to the browser with Pusher
* Integrate your own app with the generic endpoint
