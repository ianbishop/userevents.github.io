A *listener* allows you to integrate with a third-party service to
receive events.

For example, if you have a DataSift stream that monitors tweets for your
company, you can connect this stream to CxEngage by creating a DataSift listener.

That way, any tweets recorded by this stream will be forwarded to CxEngage.
This means that you can stitch different sources of events together to get the
full customer journey across multiple channels.
